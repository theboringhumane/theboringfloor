// cto.go — the office CTO ("theboringcto"): the batch-review beat and its
// once-per-drained-board latch, shared by the scripted tour (demo.go) and
// the live backend (opencode.go). Architecture-brief routing itself lives
// in state.IsArchitectureBrief — the ONE matcher, never re-checked locally.
//
// The beat: when the LAST open brief of a batch returns and the board
// drains (zero tasks in non-done states), the CTO reviews the batch — one
// EvStatus activity note plus one EvMail (MailNotice) summarizing it. The
// latch re-arms only on a NEW dispatch: a board that stays drained never
// re-reviews, and repeated drains without new work post nothing.
//
// The chair: in LIVE mode the exec suite is never empty — an idle
// pseudo-CTO (pseudoCTOEmployee) holds seat "cto" from boot (demo parity),
// is swapped for the real session-backed theboringcto-N when an
// architecture brief lands, and is re-seated when the last real one is
// removed (see normCtx.seatPseudoCTO / dropPseudoCTO in events.go).
