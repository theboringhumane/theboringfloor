// Package app — the root Bubble Tea model for theboringoffice v2: state reducer
// (exact port of node-legacy/src/app.tsx officeReducer + initialState),
// layout, key routing, the power governor, and the backend event seam.
//
// Layout: topbar (1) | middle (floor left flex | right sidebar) | statusbar (1).
// The sidebar holds six tabs — chat | terminal | agents | board | mail |
// activity — and its width is configurable (brain.json ui.sidebarWidth,
// 26..100 clamp, 0 = default 80; /compact mode narrows it to 30). /zen is a
// transient fullscreen-floor mode (sidebar hidden, any key exits).
// Events arrive as state.Event tea.Msgs (backend goroutine → tea.Program.Send);
// the animation tick is a re-arming tea.Tick loop governed by the brain.json
// power posture (power.go): busy = smooth (180ms/150ms/400ms), idle = cheap
// (1s/2s), auto drifts to 3s after 60s of quiet.
