// chat_timeline_test.go — merge proofs for the chat timeline: subagent
// thread groups (e.g. "tekton-18 · Fix Portuguese proof") must INTERLEAVE
// with the normal conversation by timestamp, ascending (oldest top,
// newest bottom) — the old pinned-bottom workers region must not
// determine ordering. An OLDER thread rises ABOVE newer chat messages (it
// never sinks to the pinned tail), a NEWER thread sits BELOW older ones,
// equal timestamps keep stable input order (the chat slice before the
// threads slice), and the merged list holds every input unit exactly
// once: len(mergeChatTimeline(c, t)) == len(c)+len(t), no duplicates.
//
// A thread sorts by the EARLIEST At among its lines — its birth slot —
// so late tool activity never swims it down past chat turns that arrived
// after the thread was born. Timestamps here are fixed literals — no
// time.Now(), the test is deterministic.
